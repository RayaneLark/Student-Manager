# Student Management System

This project is a simple Student Management System implemented in Java that I made for a university project back in 2021. It includes the creation of tables for students, professors, courses, 
and the relationship between students and courses. Additionally, it demonstrates basic SQL operations such as data insertion, modification, 
and querying.
